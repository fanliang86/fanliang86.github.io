My research interests lie at the intersection of digital media, political communication, technology governance, and computational social science. Using a mixed-methods approach, my ongoing research has two focal areas: 1) the integration of algorithmic decision-making and data analytics into politics and social life, and 2) the mechanism and consequence of political astroturfing and propaganda on digital platforms.

I am also a member of several research groups, including [Big Data Innovation and Governance Lab](https://big-dig.net/), [Politics and Communication Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/pac-lab/), and [Mobile Communication Collective](https://lsa.umich.edu/comm/research/research-groups/the-mobile-communication-collective).
