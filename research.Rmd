## Research

Broadly construed, I am interested in: 1) the use of machine learning algorithms and data science techniques in communication research; 2) the diffusion and manipulation of political information on social media; and 3) the roles that Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and big data play in shaping governance and surveillance.

My most recent research employs automated content analysis to theoretically examine how the state and news media construct and frame authoritarian politics and influence global audiences on Facebook. In addition, my coauthors and I conduct mediation analyses and find that [online expression can shape how people understand their place in political life](https://www.academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/69/1/49/5288675). For ICT and surveillance, I use process tracing to investigative [the institutional processes and goals of big data-enabled surveillance infrastructure (i.e., China's Social Credit System)](https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/poi3.183).
